# Demo Signing App

A demo app to login and sign an arbitrary message, with both MetaMask and Wally, to compare the provider api and help with implementation.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the MetaMask extension installed, and the `wally-api` running _(locally, haven't tested prod yet)_

## Install

`yarn`

## Work

`npm run dev`

## wallet-connector updates

If you make changes to the `wallet-connector`, make sure you run `npm run build` in the top level project directory to build that package.
