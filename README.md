## Wally Connector

Install the library

```
$ npm install wally-sdk
--- or ---
$ yarn wally-sdk
```

Import the init() function from the Wally library, and configure it with your clientID (available in the Wally dashboard on your appâ€™s page).

\_app.tsx

```
import { init } from 'wally';

const MyApp: React.FC<LayoutProps> = ({ Component, pageProps }) => {
 if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
   init({
     clientId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CLIENT_ID,
   });
 }

 return ...
};

export default MyApp;
```

Then, use the provider in the same manner you would use window.ethereum from metamask, or any other ethereum provider that matches the EIP-1193 spec. The most common way of connecting and getting started is by fetching the wallet address:

```
import { getProvider } from 'wally';

const wallyProvider = getProvider();

wallyProvider.request({ method: 'eth_requestAccounts' })
  .then((res) => {
    setAddress(res[0]);
  });
// ----- or ------
const web3 = new Web3(wallyProvider);
web3.eth.requestAccounts().then((res) => {
  setAddress(res[0]);
});
```

If not logged in to wally, this will automatically prompt the login window and resolve the promise with the result. This login flow will also happen with any other request. Alternatively, you can call `wallyProvider.login()` directly if you need more control over the login flow.

Once your provider is configured, the rest of your app should work exactly the same way that it might work with Metamask or WalletConnect and no other changes should be necessary.

The Wally SDK gets you up to speed in a matter of minutes, and with the Wally API you have tons of flexibility to modify the flow and hide Wally further in the background as needed.

Happy hacking!
